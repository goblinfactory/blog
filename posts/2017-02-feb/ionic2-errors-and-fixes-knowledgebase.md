# Alan's w-t-frak getting started with Ionic2 Knowlege base

Some error messages dont point you in the right direction, and judging by the lack of good google results, I'm guessing most good Ionic developers are so used to them by now, they don't even think about it. So this is here for me, save me repeating the same mistake too many times.

1. >[`invalid page component: tab1`](knowledge-base/invalid-page-component-tab1.md)
1. >[`Error in ./Test1Page class Test1Page - caused by: No component factory found for YourNewlyCreatedThingPage`](knowledge-base/no-component-factory-found-for-page.md)
